# IAM

authentification:
 * Username/passwords
 * MFA
 * Access Keys (Access Key Id/Secret Access Key ID)

4 types of roles:
1. AWS service Role (assume by service ec2, lambda, ...)
2. AWS Service-Linked Role (Amazon Lex Bots, Amazon Lex Channels)
3. Role for (cross) account access
4. Role for Identity Provider Access

 WebFederation: AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity

 AD/LDAP: AssumeRoleWithSAML

Other Feature
 * password policy in IAM
 * possibility to deactivate sts in certain regions
 * credential report
 * KMS

# STS
* assume-role
* assume-role-with-saml
* assume-role-with-web-identity
* get-session-token (MFA)

# EC2
ssh public key in metadata
when private ssh key is lost, snapshot and add public key.

In case compromised EC2
1. Shutdown the instance
2. snapshot to forensic
3. use it in an isolated VP
drmcgiftpx

## Autoscaling
* better fault tolerance
* better availability
* better cost manageability
standby possibility to debug
detach/attach possibility for instance to an ASG

# VPC
only one IGW at max per VPC
NACL
first rule matches
only way to block IP
Application load balancer span at least two subnet in two AZ with IGW

## EBS

Types
 * General Purpose SSD gp2
 maximazing throughput (160MiB/s) =max size of blocks (256ko)
 maximazing iops (10000) =min size of blocks (16ko)
 * Provisioned IOPS (32000iops/500MiB/s) SSD io1
 * Cold HDD sc1
 * Throughput Optimized HDD st1
 * Magnetic
burst=leakybucket with 5.4M credits at start in the bucket
in=3ips per Gib for gp2
max burst rate=3000
Constraints
 * Scale up only
 * Volumes must be in the same AZ as the EC2 instances
 * Change types by taking snapshot and using the snapshot a new volume
 * After change on the fly, 6 hours wait before another change
 * Volumes created from snapshots are Lazy restored from S3 -> forxce full read of the volume to force a restore

## EFS

 * grow and shrink automatically
 * support NFSv4
 * stored across multiple AZ's within a region
 * Read after write consistency

## CLI

* aws ec2 describe-isntances
* aws ec2 describe-images
* aws ec2 run-instances

## Metadata

http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data

## Load Balancer

* Classic
* Application Load Balancer

# SDK's

https://aws.amazon.com/tools
if default region it's us-east-1

# S3

## Properties

* object based
* unlimited storage
* 0 to 5Tb files
* files stored in buckets
* universal namespace https://s3-<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket name>
* Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
* Eventual consistency for PUTS or DELETES on existing objects

## cross region replication
* cross region replication needs for versioning
* cross region replication works for *NEW* objects
* when update an objects ALL versions are replicated
* cannot replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining 
* Delete markers are replicated, deleted versions of files are not.
* Delete individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated
* encrypted bucket are replicated

## Different tiers
* Standard (durable, immediatly available, frequently accessed)
* S3 IA (durable immediatly available, infrequently accessed)
* S3 RRS (Reduced redundancy storage

## Objects
* Key (name)
* Value (data)
* Version ID
* Metadata
* Subresousrces
 * ACL
 * Torrent

## Encryption

* SSE:
 * S3 managed Keys (SSE-S3)
 * AWS Key Management Service, (Managed Keys SSE-KMS)
 * SSE with customer provided keys (SSE-C)
* Client Side Encryption

## Versioning

* store all version of an object
* great backup tool
* If activated cannot remove versioning Can only suspend it
* Integrate with lifecycle rules
* MFA Delete capability

## Lifecycle management

* with or without versioning

## multipart upload
* required from 5Go

# Content Delivery Network
* Edge Location: location where content is cached (different from AZ)
* Origin origin of all files distritubed by the CDN (S3 Bucket, EC2 instance, ELB, Route53)
* Distribution: collection of Edge Locations
* Edge location are not just read only
* objects are cache for the file of the TTL
* possibility of clear cache, but this is charged

# Storage Gateway (check for novelty!)

virtual appliance (VMware ESXi or MS hyperV) asynchronously replicate S3 (or Glacier)
 * File Gateway (NFS)
 * Volumes Gateway (iSCSI) (backed up as point-in-time snapshots of volumes and stored in the cloud as Amazon S3 incremental snapshots) (EBS or S3?)
   * Stored Volumes (1Gb-16Tb)
   * Cached Volumes (recent data stored locally only) (1Gb-32Tb)
 * Tape Gateway (VTL) (used for backup)

# Snowball
* Snowball (Import/Export from S3)
* Snowball edge (onboard storage and compute capabilities)
* Snowmobile (storage truck) (~100Pb)

# Transfer acceleration
 * use local edge location

# Databases

* RDS OLTP
  * MySQL Multi-AZ deployments for high availability and read replicas for horizontal scaling
  * PostgreSQL Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and read replicas for horizontal scaling.
  * Aurora Each instance is a multi-AZ cluster (up to 15 read replicas to increase performance or multi-AZ for high availabily)
    aurora has storage auto scaling
    snapshot saved in S3
    two types of replicas:
    * replicas with same underlying storage with low impact on master, enables failover without dataloss
	* readreplicas
  * MariaDB has support for Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas.
  * Oracle
  * Microsoft SQL Server
Two mechanisms for backing up.
  * automated backups (RDS feature which create a storage volume snapshots of DB instance 1 retention day by default up to 35)
  * manual snapshots
Limitations:
  * mssql not able to scale storage
* DynamoDB No SQL
  * fully managed database
  * both document and key-value data
  * stored on SSD storage
  * spread across geographically distinct data centres
  * two models:
    * Eventual Consistent Reads (Default and Best read Performance)
    * Strongly consistent reads
  * Consists of
    * tables
    * Items (rows)
    * Attributes (columns)
  * nested (until 35 nested)
  * Charged by
    * provisioned thoughput Capacity
    * charged per Gb
  * Two types of primary keys
    * partition key (hash key) (single attribute primary key)
    * sort key (range key) (composite primary keys)
  * Index
    * Local secondary index: (same partition, different sort key, only when table created)
    * Global secondary index: (different partition, different sort key, at creation time or later)
  * scan vs query
    * query: With a partition key attribute name and distinct value to search for
    * scan: Scan operation returns all the data attributes for every items with the possibility of use the ProjectExpression
  * provisioned throughput
    * read 4k + number of reads/s (/2 if eventually consistent)
    * write 1k + number of write/s
    * error 400 ProvisionedThroughputExceededException (for a table or for one or more secondary indexes)
  * BatchWriteItem
    * puts or delete mutliple items in one or more tables
    * checks for unprocessed items until all items have been processed
  * DynamoDB Streams
    * KEYS_ONLY
    * NEW_IMAGE entire item after the update
    * OLD_IMAGE entire item before the update (all can be rebuilt with the actual value)
